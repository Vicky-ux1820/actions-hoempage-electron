# Building the Electron App with React Integration

This guide will help you build the provided Electron app that integrates React. Follow these steps to set up and run your app.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Node.js**:  
   Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). Ensure it is added to your system PATH.  
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. **Install Git**:  
   [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for version control.

3. **Install Required Tools**:  
   Ensure you have the following tools installed:
   - Electron
   - Electron Builder
   - Webpack

4. **Project Structure**:  
   Your project files should include:
   - `package.json`
   - `main.js`
   - `preload.js` (if applicable)
   - React app in the `public` and `src` folders.

---

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

---

## Step 2: Run the Development Server

1. Start the React development server and Electron simultaneously:
   ```bash
   npm run react-electron
   ```

2. React will start on `http://localhost:3000`, and Electron will launch using this URL.

---

## Step 3: Build for Production

1. Build the React application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Package the app using Electron Builder:
   ```bash
   npm run dist
   ```

3. The production-ready app will be located in the `dist` folder.

## Configuration Highlights

### package.json

- The `package.json` includes custom scripts to streamline your workflow:
  - **Start React development server**: `npm run start`
  - **Run Electron in development**: `npm run electron`
  - **Simultaneous React and Electron**: `npm run react-electron`
  - **Build React and Electron app**: `npm run prod`
  - **Package for production**: `npm run dist`

- **Electron Builder Configuration**:
  - App ID: `com.electron.reactapp`
  - Product Name: `Electron React App`
  - File associations: Supports `.project-eigenspace` files.

### main.js

- The `main.js` file manages Electron processes and integrates the React app.
- **Notable Features**:
  - Automatically opens `.project-eigenspace` files if provided.
  - Creates a root project file at `.project-eigenspace` if it does not exist.
  - Secures the app using `contextIsolation` and a preload script.

Example: Loading React in production:
```javascript
const startURL =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? path.join('file://', __dirname, 'build', 'index.html')
    : 'http://localhost:3000';

mainWindow.loadURL(startURL);
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Dependencies**:  
   Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.

2. **React App Not Loading in Electron**:  
   Ensure the `startURL` in `main.js` points to the correct file or development server.

3. **Build Errors**:  
   Check your Node.js version compatibility with Electron and React.

4. **Debugging**:  
   Enable developer tools in `main.js` during development:
   ```javascript
   mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();
   ```

---

## Final Notes

- Use `npm run dev` for concurrent development of React and Electron.
- The `.project-eigenspace` file ensures the app operates as an Eigenspace project.
